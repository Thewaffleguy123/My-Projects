My Projects
Welcome to My Projects, a repository where I showcase my coding journey, store my various projects, and offer others the chance to learn, get inspired, or contribute. This is a growing space where I will upload a variety of programming projects, from simple scripts to more complex AI and machine learning developments.

Purpose of this Repository
This repository serves several purposes:

Project Showcase: A place to organize and present all the coding projects I’m working on.
Learning Resource: You can explore these projects to learn new concepts, techniques, and approaches.
Project Organization: It helps me keep track of my coding progress, making it easy to return and revise as needed.
For Employers: A portfolio of my work to showcase my skills to potential future employers or collaborators.
Projects
1. Voltage-Current-Resistance Calculator
Language: Python
Description: A simple program that uses Ohm’s Law to calculate voltage, current, or resistance when the other two variables are provided by the user.
Goal: To provide a functional program that helps users understand basic electrical principles in a hands-on way.
More projects will be added as I continue to develop new code.

Tools Used
Python: The primary language I am using for most of my current projects.
Visual Studio Code (VS Code): My preferred code editor.
Future Plans for this Repository
As I learn and develop new skills, this repository will grow with me. Some upcoming ideas include:

AI & Machine Learning Projects: As I learn more about artificial intelligence and neural networks, I’ll be posting those projects here.
Web Development: I plan to branch out into web development, so expect to see front-end and back-end projects in the future.
Automation Scripts: I'll share scripts that automate daily tasks to make life easier.
